### Component Details

#### Arduino Mega 2560 (ELEGOO)

**Specifications:**
- Microcontroller: ATmega2560
- Operating Voltage: 5V
- Digital I/O Pins: 54 (15 provide PWM output)
- Analog Input Pins: 16
- Flash Memory: 256 KB
- SRAM: 8 KB
- Clock Speed: 16 MHz

**Why This Board:**
- Sufficient I/O pins (54 vs. Uno's 14) for multiplexer control
- Adequate memory (256 KB) for chess algorithm implementation
- Stable 3.3V output for LED power
- USB interface for programming and serial communication

#### CD74HC4067 Multiplexers

**Specifications:**
- Channels: 16 (individually selectable)
- Control Inputs: 4-bit binary (S0-S3)
- Operating Voltage: 2V to 6V
- Enable Pin: Active LOW
- Switching Speed: High-speed CMOS
- Package: DIP or breakout board

**Functionality:**
- Reduces 16 I/O lines to 5 pins (4 control + 1 signal)
- Bidirectional operation (can read or write)
- Low ON-state resistance
- High OFF-state isolation

**Why 4 Multiplexers:**
- 64 squares ÷ 16 channels = 4 multiplexers needed
- Each MUX controls one 4×4 quadrant of the board

#### 1kΩ Resistors

**Specifications:**
- Resistance: 1000Ω (±5% tolerance)
- Power Rating: ¼W
- Type: Carbon film or metal film

**Purpose:**
- Current limiting for LED protection
- One resistor per multiplexer signal pin
- Prevents excessive current draw from Arduino

**Current Calculation:**
```
I = V / R = 3.3V / 1000Ω = 3.3mA per LED
Safe operating range for typical LEDs: 2-20mA
```

#### Pre-wired SMD Micro LEDs

**Specifications:**
- Size: SMD micro (compact for under-tile mounting)
- Colors: Red, Yellow, Green (25 each)
- Pre-soldered leads: Simplifies installation
- Forward Voltage: ~2-3V
- Forward Current: ~20mA (max)

**Design Choice:**
- Pre-wired construction saves soldering time
- Small size fits beneath chess tiles
- Multiple colors available for move indication (optional)

## Component Substitutions

**Acceptable Alternatives:**

- **Arduino:** Any compatible board with 20+ I/O pins (Mega, Due, etc.)
- **Multiplexers:** 74HC4067 (non-CD variant) works identically
- **Resistors:** 820Ω to 1.5kΩ range acceptable (adjust for LED specs)
- **LEDs:** Any small LEDs with appropriate voltage/current ratings

**Not Recommended:**

- Arduino Uno (insufficient pins even with multiplexers)
- Higher resistance values (>2kΩ) may produce dim LEDs
- Non-pre-wired LEDs (significantly increases assembly time)
